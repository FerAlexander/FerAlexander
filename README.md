- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FerAlexander
- With a fusion of analytics and artistry, my path has evolved from leading Happy Fenix as CEO to delving into data as a Business Intelligence Analyst. At the intersection of music and metric-driven insights, I harness Tableau to transform complex data into strategic business intelligence. My Coursera certificates in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Project Management fuel my ability to deliver impactful analysis.

My tenure as Director at Oncologia mÃ³vil ingrained in me the significance of clear, actionable insights in high-stakes environments. Now, equipped with Google's Project Management Specialization, I adeptly steer projects toward success. I am committed to leveraging my cross-disciplinary expertise to innovate and drive excellence in data-driven decision-making.
